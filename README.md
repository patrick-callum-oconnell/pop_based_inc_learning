# pop_based_inc_learning
A C based implementation of Population Based Incremental Learning that solves MAXSAT problems in conjunctive normal form.

This used to be a Python-driven program, but I've since converted it to C for speed.

Command line arguments:

(1) pop_size, int, number of vectors generated by prob_vector for a given population,
(2) lr, double, the learning rate,
(3) negative_lr, double, the negative learning rate,
(4) mut_probability, mutation probability for a given bit,
(5) mut_shift, the amount mutation alters a bit,
(6) max_iterations, int, the maximum number of iterations allowed,
(7) file_name, string, the name of the .cnf file
(8) print_generations, int, 1 if yes, 0 if no (whether or not the program will periodically print results)

OLD:
PBIL.py holds the class representation of the probability vector and the current population, as well as the various operations on that population
and vector. The c_helper_functions.c file holds functions that perform vector alteration and population generation to speed up the algorithm's progress
(with respect to slow python lists, or even NumPy cythonic arrays which are currently the placeholders until the c helper file is done).

NEW:
PBIL.py holds the class representation of the probability vector and the current population, as well as the various operations on that population
and vector. 

The c_helper_functions.c file holds functions that perform population generation and alteration and mutation of the probability vector (e.g. the actual operations of PBIL).

dependencies.c holds a couple functions that are used to parse cnf (conjunctive normal form) files with MAXSAT problems and to use those to evaluate the fitness of a candidate solution generated by PBIL.
